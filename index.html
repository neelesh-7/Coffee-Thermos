        <h1><strong>Coffee</strong> Thermos</h1>
        <p>A coffee thermos uses vacuum technology to keep warm drinks at their temperature for many hours. There are
          different kinds of thermoses; ones that keep drinks cold and ones that keep drinks warm. I will focus on the
          thermoses that keep drinks warm. It is important to know that a coffee thermos can only slow down the rate at
          which the heat escapes, not completely stop it, and eventually the drink will reach room temperature. The
          coffee thermos has a very minimal amount of heat escaping, this is a constant rate. </p>

        <h2>What are <strong>They?</strong></h2>
        <p>Coffee thermoses come in different shapes, sizes and prices. They are very effective with their Vacuum
          Insulation Technology (VIT), which has been in use for over 100 years. Coffee thermoses have different ways of
          using them. Some have a sliding opening on the lid or unique designs like a leak-proof design for safe
          transportation. However, the feature that stands above all the rest is ease of use. The best coffee thermoses
          easily open, close and pour, they don’t spill and are lightweight. Companies sell a variety of coffee
          thermoses in the world. Each coffee thermos has a special feature that helps them stand out from the rest.
          Like the Stanley Classic Legendary Bottle, which is extremely durable and can keep your drink warm for quite a
          long time.</p>

        <h1><strong>History of</strong> Coffee Thermoses</h1>
        <p>In 1892, James Dewar, a Scottish scientist working at Cambridge University, needed something that could help
          keep his cold liquid oxygen at -300°F (-184.44°C). He came up with a thermos-like invention that was able to
          keep the liquid oxygen at its temperature without absorbing the heat from its surroundings. Then in 1904,
          Thermos LLC thought of incorporating that idea into these insulated food and beverage containers. Many years
          later, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation sold the world’s first vacuum thermos in 1978. Since then they have
          improved the quality and the variety of thermoses. The term “thermos” comes from the company, Thermos LLC,
          which initially had the idea of incorporating it into the food and drinks industry. From 1910 to 1922, it was
          practically free advertising for them. In 1923, the name finally got registered, making it official.</p>

        <h2>How do <strong>Coffee Thermoses Work?</strong></h2>
        <p>A coffee thermos uses a certain type of thermal insulation to reduce the transfer of heat as much as possible
          from the system (warm drink) to the surroundings (air outside the thermos). A coffee thermos has an inner wall
          and an outer wall that has a low-pressure area in between them acting as thermal insulation. This is a vacuum
          seal which is an airless void, one that doesn’t have any air or matter between the two walls. This vacuum is a
          great way to prevent heat transfer by eliminating conduction and convection, as learned in grade 11, to try
          and keep the temperature inside as warm as possible. The inner wall of the vacuum seal is made of either
          stainless steel or glass walls which can retain the heat. The inner wall is covered with a reflective silver
          layer that reduces the amount of heat that is lost by bouncing the heat radiation back into the beverage. Then
          to cover up the drink, there is an insulated lid to keep heat from escaping at the top and from accidental
          spills or leaks.</p>

        <p>Let’s get more into this vacuum seal which is called the Vacuum Insulation Technology (VIT). It is a double
          or multi-layered system creating an extremely low-pressure area in between. There is a Vacuum Insulation Panel
          (VIP) that covers the vacuum making it air-tight. This panel is made from fumed silicon which is from silicon
          dioxide, and is one of the lightest substances that exist. This panel insulates about 10 times better than any
          other insulation materials by being able to eliminate gas conduction because of the vacuum, using a material
          that isn’t flammable, and sealing the material with a gas-vapor-tight film. This method is effective and is
          guaranteed to last a lifetime. </p>

        <h2><strong>Usability</strong></h2>
        <p>Using a coffee thermos is pretty simple. It is wise to warm up the thermos before pouring your drink using
          hot water. Letting it sit there for a couple of minutes, and then emptying it helps your beverage to be warmer
          for a little longer. After you pour the warm drink into the thermos, make sure not to overfill it, as it would
          make it easy to leak (you don’t want that while driving). Once you have poured the warm drink, you can put the
          lid on tightly. Creating a seal that prevents the heat from escaping. Once you have drunk the beverage, make
          sure to clean the thermos properly to prevent any stains or bad odor. Before throwing it in the dishwasher,
          make sure to check if your coffee thermos is dishwasher safe.</p>

        <h2>Relation to <strong>Thermochemistry</strong></h2>
        <p>The way a coffee thermos functions is similar to a coffee cup calorimeter because they both use insulating
          materials that focus on minimizing heat transfer, both in and out. They both have an insulated lid at the top,
          with 2 insulated walls. Undergoing both an endothermic and exothermic reaction depending on the system. If the
          system (a drink in a thermos and a solution in a calorimeter) is warmer than the surroundings (air for a
          thermos and H2O for a calorimeter) then it will be an exothermic reaction. A thermos also changes temperature
          (ΔT = Tf - Ti), and the lowest it will ever go will be room temperature. Finding the enthalpy (ΔH) for an
          exothermic reaction is similar to finding the enthalpy for a coffee cup calorimeter. Knowing that ΔHrxn would
          be negative because the energy released is greater than the energy absorbed. Thus energy was lost. You would
          go about solving for ΔH using the following equations: Qsurr = mcΔT (m is the mass of the warm liquid in the
          thermos, c is the specific heat of the air, ΔT is the change in temperature that the warm liquid experienced),
          then Qrxn = -Qsurr, and finally ΔHrxn = -Qrxn/n (n is the number of moles used in the reaction - Limiting
          Reactant).</p>

        <p>Let’s say that I pour hot chocolate at 80°C into a 500mL coffee thermos with the room temperature at 22°C.
          Let’s assume that the specific heat for hot chocolate is similar to water’s — 4.184J/g°C. We can also assume
          that 1g is equal to 1mL, so the mass of the hot chocolate is 500g. We can substitute it in the equation which
          looks like this: Qsurr = (500g)(4.184 J/g°C)(58°C). This equals to 121,336J, which is 121.336kJ. Now we can
          find the moles, n and then solve for ΔHrxn, which would be a negative number, using the -Qrxn/n equation (Qrxn
          = -Qsurr).</p>

        <p>The Vacuum Insulation Panels used by coffee thermoses are used in construction, appliances, and storage
          units. In homes, buildings and other areas that use heating or air conditioning, Vacuum Insulation Panels are
          placed inside the walls, behind the drywall and in between the wood/metal rods.

        <p>Coffee thermoses are used to keep beverages warm for several hours. They are used by people who are always
          busy and want to enjoy their warm homemade drink on the go. Coffee thermoses are very popular among campers,
          hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts. They can take warm drinks on thrilling adventures with a warm meal
          outdoors. Instead of always buying Tim Hortons to work every day, you can make any homemade drink and drink it
          on the way with your coffee thermos. Using a reusable coffee thermos instead of disposable cups is a much more
          environmentally friendly option. It helps society take that step forward to create a more sustainable
          environment.

        <p>Unlike a coffee thermos that keeps drinks warm, NASA’s astronaut spacesuits keep the astronaut cool from the
          intense heat of the sun when in space. You can say that the suit has a similar function to a thermos that
          keeps food or drinks cold. When astronauts worked long hours in space, their suits weren't able to maintain a
          constant temperature. So NASA scientists created new spacesuits that have phase-changing materials (PCM).
          Phase-change materials can absorb, hold and release heat to keep the person or people inside comfortable. It
          is used in blankets, bed sheets, and other clothing. This has also been implemented in the thermal control of
          the spacecraft, to maintain the temperature inside. “Phase change material heat exchangers are perfectly
          suited for maintaining a habitable environment and component temperatures in low lunar orbit. If we didn’t
          include this kind of system in Orion, the crew would get too hot and then too cold.” (Henson, 2023)

        <p>
        <ol>Even though coffee thermoses are reliable, some issues arise:
          <li>Retaining the smell of the most commonly used beverage in the thermos if you don’t clean it properly. This
            disrupts the smell and taste of other beverages you might drink.</li>
          <li>Some aren’t designed for ease of use and have complaints about the leakage for every sip.</li>
          <li>Some may look good, but sometimes are very easily destroyed with scratches.</li>
          <li>Difficulty cleaning because of the limited opening in the lid, or the stains that build over time.</li>
          <li>Some are heavy and don’t fit in cup holders. This will give you lots of discomfort when driving, and
            potentially even make you go back to disposable cups.</li>
          <li>Some don’t keep drinks hot for as long as you might expect.</li>
